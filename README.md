# homebridge-twinkly

[![verified-by-homebridge](https://badgen.net/badge/homebridge/verified/purple)](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/Verified-Plugins)

Unofficial [Homebridge](http://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin for [Twinkly](https://www.twinkly.com) decorative smart lights

## Features

Use Siri or HomeKit automation to:
- Turn lights on or off
- Change brightness
- Change the color

A simple command line tool is also included.

## Setup

1. First set up [Homebridge](http://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).
2. Configure Twinkly using the iOS or Android app and make sure it's connected to the same network.
3. Install `homebridge-twinkly` using [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x) or manually using `sudo npm install -g homebridge-twinkly`.

### Configuration options

| Value                          | Default       | Description                                                 |
|--------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| allowBrightnessControl         | true          | Adds a brightness control instead of a simple on/off switch |
| allowColorControl              | true          | Adds a color picker/wheel to the brightness control slider  |
| removeUnreachableDeviceMinutes | 0             | When to remove unreachable devices (0 meaning never)        |

The options can be configured using the UI or manually in a config.json.

### Example config.json

```json
{
  "bridge": {
    "name": "…"
  },
  "platforms": [{
    "platform": "Twinkly",
    "allowBrightnessControl": true,
    "allowColorControl": true,
    "removeUnreachableDeviceMinutes": 0
  }]
}
```

## Setup as accessory (deprecated)

Prior to version 0.4.0 all lights had to be added individually. This is still possible, but is deprecated. Use this if device discovery doesn't work in your network.

You'll need to find the IP address of each light using the Twinkly app. It might be useful to have your router always assign it the same IP address.

### Configuration options

| Value                  | Default       | Description                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| accessory              | (required)    | Identifies module and must be `"Twinkly"`                   |
| name                   | (required)    | The name for light as it will appear in HomeKit             |
| ip                     | (required)    | The IP address of the lights.                               |
| allowBrightnessControl | true          | Adds a brightness control instead of a simple on/off switch |
| allowColorControl      | true          | Adds a color picker/wheel to the brightness control slider  |

The options can be configured using the UI or manually in a config.json.
Multiple lights are can be added as individual accessories.

### Example config.json

```json
{
  "bridge": {
    "name": "…"
  },

    "accessory": "Twinkly",
    "name": "Christmas Lights",
